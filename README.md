Task Description
You are required to create a high-level design document for a system that processes live camera feeds to identify people biometrically using a pre-trained machine learning model. The system should be architected to use C++ for handling the camera feed and Python for processing the images from the video feed through the machine learning model.
Requirements
You are required to create a design document not more than two A4 pages that outlines the following requirements.
System Overview: Provide a brief description of the entire system, including its purpose and key components.
Component Design:
C++ Camera Feed Handler: Describe the component that simulates or handles live camera feeds. This includes capturing images from the camera and preparing them for processing. Although you are not writing code, describe how you would implement this component in C++, focusing on performance considerations due to the time-sensitive nature of live feed processing.
Python Image Processing Module: Outline how the images from the C++ component would be received and processed in Python. Include a description of the interface to a pre-trained machine learning model for biometric identification. Discuss how Python's ecosystem (libraries and frameworks) can be utilised for efficient image processing and model integration.
Inter-Process Communication (IPC): Without providing specific code, detail the method you would choose for IPC between the C++ and Python components. Explain why this method is suitable for real- time processing needs and how it supports the system's time-critical aspect.
Error Handling and Logging: Briefly describe how your design addresses potential errors (e.g., camera feed interruption, model processing failures) and how logging is handled across the system for monitoring and debugging purposes.
Scalability and Performance Considerations: Discuss how your system design can scale to handle multiple camera feeds simultaneously and what performance optimisations can be considered to ensure timely processing of the feeds.
Evaluation Criteria
Completeness: The document covers all required aspects of the system design.
Clarity: The design is clearly articulated, making it understandable to someone familiar with software development but not necessarily with the specifics of C++ or Python.
Realism: The design choices are practical and consider real-world constraints such as performance and scalability.
Creativity: Innovative approaches to solving design challenges, particularly in integrating C++ and Python components and handling live data feeds.
